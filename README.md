# Mastering the box model

This example page is insprired by chapter three of the book [CSS in depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth).  
This is both a way for me to fix the concepts illustrated there and an useful reference for anyone interested in learning CSS. 

This example page illustrates several quircks of CSS: 
 
  - how to get a more predictable box model by using the *border-box* value for *box-sizing* property
  - how to create a simple two column layout with equal eight columns by using CSS tables 
  - how to vertically space items inside a container by using a minimal amount of code resilient to page changes with the so called *lobotomized owl selector*
